# miniTekken

this is my tiny-mini implementation for the game 'Tekken' that i used to play as a little boy.
the code is written in Js, HTML and CSS.

<hr>
<b> How to play:</b>
<br> Use the buttons displayed on the screen
<hr>
<b> Game rules:</b>
<ol>
  <li> You start off with 50 health points.</li>
  <li> You can use the 'heal' option one time in each game. it will add another 20 points to your health balance. don't use is unless you really need it.</li>
  <li>You can use the 'strong attack' two times in each game. it will increase the amount of force when you hit the montser. BUT, it is not guaranteed that the hit would be stronger. it is also a matter of luck.</li>
</ol>
